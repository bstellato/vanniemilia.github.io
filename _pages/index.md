## About me

I am a Postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Biological Chemistry & Molecular Pharmacology](http://bcmp.hms.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Don Coen](http://bcmp.hms.harvard.edu/person/faculty/donald-coen).

Before joining Harvard, I was a Postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Pediatrics Infectious Diseases](http://med.stanford.edu/pedsid.html), [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Ann Arvin](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ann-arvin). I conducted research in viral transcriptomics during human skin infection. My research topic was **The Latency-Associated Transcript Locus of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 is a Virulence Determinant in Human Skin**.

I received my PhD (D.Phil.) under the supervision of [Dr Chris Boutell](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/iii/staff/chrisboutell/) in the department of [MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/iii/cvr/), [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/) in 2011. I specialised in viral ubiquitin ligases and their ability to degrade cellular antiviral proteins. My thesis topic was **Identification and functional characterisation of residues required for ICP0â€™s interaction with cellular E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes**. My PhD was funded by [Medical Research Council](https://www.mrc.ac.uk/).

Prior to my PhD studies, I received a BSc (Hons) degree in Virology from [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/) in 2007; with a sponsored exchange year in [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2004-2005.

## Research interests

My research area is Virology and Infectious diseases. My previous work focussed on ubiquitin and SUMO signalling during viral infections. I am especially interested in viral pathogenesis and transcription in human skin and neurones. My current research topic is **Herpes Simplex Virus 1 transcription during latency in neurones**.
